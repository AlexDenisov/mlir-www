## Flang: the LLVM Fortran compiler

The high level IR of the Fortran compiler is modeled using MLIR.

## [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/mlir)
  MLIR is used as a Graph Transformation framework and the foundation for
  building many tools (TFLite converter, quantization, ...).

## [RISE](https://rise-lang.org/)

RISE is a spiritual successor to the
[Lift project](http://www.lift-project.org/): "a high-level functional data
parallel language with a system of rewrite rules which encode algorithmic
and hardware-specific optimisation choices".
